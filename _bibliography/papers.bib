  abstract = {Wireless mouse rings offer subtle, reliable pointing interactions for wearable computing platforms. However, the small battery below 27 mAh in the miniature rings restricts the ring's continuous lifespan to just 1-10 hours, because even low-powered wireless communication such as BLE is power-consuming for ring's continuous use. The ring's short lifespan frequently disrupts users' mouse use with the need for frequent charging. This paper presents picoRing mouse, enabling a continuous ring-based mouse interaction with ultra-low-powered ring-to-wristband wireless connectivity. picoRing mouse employs a coil-based impedance sensing named semi-passive inductive telemetry, allowing a wristband coil to capture a unique frequency response of a nearby ring coil via a sensitive inductive coupling between the coils. The ring coil converts the corresponding user's mouse input into the unique frequency response via an up to 449 uW mouse-driven modulation system. Therefore, the continuous use of picoRing mouse can last approximately 600 (8hrs use/day)-1000 (4hrs use/day) hours on a single charge of a 27 mAh battery while supporting subtle thumb-to-index scrolling and pressing interactions in real-world wearable computing situations.},

  abstract = {Wireless mouse rings offer subtle, reliable pointing interactions for wearable computing platforms. However, the small battery below 27 mAh in the miniature rings restricts the ring’s continuous lifespan to just 1-2 hours, because current low-powered wireless communication such as BLE is power-consuming for ring’s continuous use. The ring’s short lifespan persistently disrupts users’ mouse use with the need for frequent charging. This interactivity demonstrates picoRing mouse, enabling a continuous ring-based mouse interaction with ultra-low-powered ring-to-wristband wireless communication. picoRing mouse employs a coil-based impedance sensing named semi-passive inductive telemetry, allowing a wristband coil to capture a unique frequency response of a nearby ring coil via a sensitive inductive coupling between the coils. The ring coil converts the corresponding user’s mouse input into the unique frequency response via an 820 uW mouse-driven modulation module. Therefore, continuous use of picoRing mouse can potentially last over 92 hours on a single charge of a 20-mAh small battery.},

  abstract = {Prototyping electronic textile involves embedding electronic components into fabrics to develop smart clothing with specific functionalities. However, this process is still challenging since the complicated wiring setup is required during experimental phases. This paper presents plug-n-play e-knit, a large-scale, repositionable e-textile for providing trial-and-error prototyping platforms across the textile. Plug-n-play e-knit leverages industrial digital knitting machines loaded with conductive thread to automatically embed a communication and power supply network into garments, in addition to using soft magnet connectors to rearrange electronic components while preserving the stretchability of the garment. These combinations enable users to quickly establish e-textile sensor networks, and moreover test the performance and optimal placement of the electric devices on the textile. We demonstrated that our textiles leveraging custom I2C protocols could achieve the motion-resilient motion-tracking sensor network over a 2700 cm2 garment area.},
